Atoms are the basic particles of the chemical elements. 
An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, 
surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons. 
The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the 
number of protons that are in their atoms. For example, any atom 
that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 
protons is copper. Atoms with the same number of protons but a 
different number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element.

Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. 
A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide. This is smaller 
than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans 
cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. Atoms are so small 
that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics 
is not possible due to quantum effects.
